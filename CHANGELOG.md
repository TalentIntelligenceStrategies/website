## Entries

- **2026-05-06 22:37 +08:00** · Replaced native Inquiry-Type select with §Select brand dropdown (underline trigger variant) and added html scroll-padding-top so top-nav anchors land below the fixed 64px nav.
- **2026-05-06 21:23 +08:00** · Shifted .section padding-block onto the contained .container for Latest-reports + About so the gradient covers the full vertical extent (no exposed page-surface strip top/bottom).
- **2026-05-06 21:19 +08:00** · Contained Latest-reports / About / Contact backgrounds + borders within the 1440px container (moved off the full-bleed section), matching the Products framing.
- **2026-05-06 21:15 +08:00** · Extended Services-section bronze top, ticker, and bronze bottom out to the container's outer edge (margin-inline breakout) and bumped inner padding 64px → 96px to keep the inner frame proportional.
- **2026-05-06 21:06 +08:00** · Reworked Services-section ticker to page surface + hairline rules; added ITRI dark-mode SVG variants (white wordmark) for featured logo and partner strip.
- **2026-05-06 16:42 +08:00** · Self-hosted Urbanist, Inconsolata, Noto Sans TC TTFs from brand monorepo; removed Google Fonts CDN links, added preload for Urbanist Regular.
- **2026-05-06 16:29 +08:00** · Initial repo split out of TIS brand monorepo; PRD moved to TIS root, README + this changelog seeded.
